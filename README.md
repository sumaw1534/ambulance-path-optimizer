using social information networks concepts

The graph structure can be used to represent many real â€“ world networks and one among them 
is the road network. The way how different roads are connected to each other and how different 
places are connected by roads can be visualized with the help of graphs. By understanding the 
network of roads, we can find many useful insights like shortest path decision. The shortest 
path decision is inevitable in sectors like delivery services, public transport services and 
ambulance service. The effectiveness of the ambulance resides in how fast it reaches the nearby 
hospital from the starting place. This project aims to find the shortest path for an ambulance in 
the given road network. Also, the project proposes a model that helps to analyze and report on 
the efficiency of any given road network in ambulance services.
